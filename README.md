# Coding Interview Guide
Hi, I started writing this when I was preparing for google interviews, I went through many interview guides and videos, and compiled them here, with some of my thoughts and experience. If you are preparing for interviews, hope this might help. Also, I am open to suggestions.
### How will interview start:
Interviewer always start with a brief introduction about themselves(in their current company only). After that, they will tell you about a bit of work/tech stack. There are generally two interviewers in an interview, one is the main interviewer, other is the senior guy, which acts as observer, and sometimes pitchin in case, he has something to ask, or want to correct something. Post that, your interview starts with a very basic question: Tell us something about yourself.
### How to answer "Tell me something about yourself?"
Well, you should preferably start with your degree, in chronological order. Resumes, are generally made in anti-chronological order, but in interview, your chronological order matters, because only that will showcase your growth and have impact on interviewers mind.

You start to answer this question with education first. Don't tell anything about schooling and where you belong, etc etc, as no interviewer cares about your such personal details and since interview time is limited, try to save time from such useless description. 
You should generally start with your undergraduate, though everywhere when you see answer for the above question, people will argue to start with your name, and belonging, but I have seen in past experiences, interviewers generally doesn't want to even listen to your name from your end, as it is anyways redundant.
So, you go ahead and start with your undergraduate degree. 
> Yes, I completed my bachelors in computer science and engineering from XYZ college, in 2016.

After that, you continue with your post grad degree.
> After that, I joined ABC college, and completed my masters in computer science and engineering in 2018. 

If you have done PHD, or some other degree, you should mention and continue in same way. 
Also, do mention anything important that you have achieved during this period, like an important thesis, or a directors medal or anything.

Post this, you will start with your professional experience, in choronological order.
> I started my career with XYZ company, in Jan 2019. I was working on XYZ project, after that, I started with ABC project. My techstack during my tenure there was, X, Y, Z, ABC. 

After that, if you have switched to a different company before, you will start with why you switched.
> During my tenure in XYZ company, I felt a need for change as my techstack and job satisfaction was not enough. I started preparing, and got a offer from JKL company.

After all that, you reason them, why are you switching and why this company, or say something about your plans.
> Now I am looking for a change as I feel my knowledge is not being utilized and work is not challenging enough. I think I will get enough challenging work in GHJ.

### Technical interview starts 
Interviewer will ask you a question that can be specific, or underspecified. ***Always think out loud, tell them everything you are thinking.***

#### Clarification Phase
First thing you need to do is repeat question once. Write some test cases, very basic, only 2 to 3 and solve them manually and get them confirmed with interviewer. This will ensure that you understood the question completely. Ask interviewer if they have any specific test case to consider. Ask for any limitations/requirements they have in mind. If you have any assumptions do let them know, so they can help you with those, or guide you which one you can consider. 

#### Thinking Phase
After this, first you need to think of a solution, check how much time complexity it has, and discuss the same with the interviewer. Check if it will be able to solve the problem and handle cases. Once it is done, try to optimize it in terms of space and time. Check again if optimized solution will be able to handle everything. Check if you are missing something. Think on the solution again, like you never made it before. All this, because people make mistakes. It will be fine if you are able to correct them during the interview itself. 

Now you have a solution in mind, now think what data structures will help you build your solution. Is it a stack, an array, a queue or a dictionary. Check always if there is a limitation to what you are going to use. Discuss the data structure you have in mind with the interviewer. It is always the case, that if you are going wrong, and missing something out, they are going to help you. Anyways an interview is just a discussion among two software engineers.

#### Now you have a solution in mind. What to do next?
Start with the code. You have a language. You are going to use that, and write something on a plain document. So, you need to have proficiency in atleast in one language.
There are certain things that are needed in your code:
1. Code should be clean.
2. Use proper variable names instead of a, x or something.
3. Code should be production ready.
4. You should have modularised code.
5. Test if it is will work correct or fail.

#### You have a code written. Now what?
1. Try to do dry runs on some examples.
2. Try to test against corner cases.
3. Think what will happen for an empty input.
4. Think what will happen for null input.
5. Check for interesting inputs in mind, like out of range, too big number, negative number and so on.

### How to behave in interview?
1. **Talk and clarify** Always talk. Think out loud. Keep disucssing with the interviewer whatever is on your mind. Whatever the question is, always think and clarify some inputs, so you don't miss anything important.
2. **Think** Always think. Anything you are writing/coding and answering, keep on thinking. There is always a chance that something important will come up if you keep thinking and you can avoid such mistakes.
3. **Practice** Always practice. For any coding interview, all you need it practice. Revise data structures and algorithms, have their complexities in mind, so you can design a solution accordingly.

And last, Best of Luck!
