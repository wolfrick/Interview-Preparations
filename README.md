# Interview-Process
Hi, I started writing this when I was preparing for google interviews, I went through many interview guides and videos, and compiled them here, with some of my thoughts and experience. If you are preparing for interviews, hope this might help. Also, I am open to suggestions.
### How will interview start:
Interviewer always start with a brief introduction about themselves(in their current company only). After that, they will tell you about a bit of work/tech stack. There are generally two interviewers in an interview, one is the main interviewer, other is the senior guy, which acts as observer, and sometimes pitchin in case, he has something to ask, or want to correct something. Post that, your interview starts with a very basic question: Tell us something about yourself.
### How to answer "Tell me something about yourself?"
Well, you should preferably start with your degree, in chronological order. Resumes, are generally made in anti-chronological order, but in interview, your chronological order matters, because only that will showcase your growth and have impact on interviewers mind.

You start to answer this question with education first. Don't tell anything about schooling and where you belong, etc etc, as no interviewer cares about your such personal details and since interview time is limited, try to save time from such useless description. 
You should generally start with your undergraduate, though everywhere when you see answer for the above question, people will argue to start with your name, and belonging, but I have seen in past experiences, interviewers generally doesn't want to even listen to your name from your end, as it is anyways redundant.
So, you go ahead and start with your undergraduate degree. 
> Yes, I completed my bachelors in computer science and engineering from XYZ college, in 2016.

After that, you continue with your post grad degree.
> After that, I joined ABC college, and completed my masters in computer science and engineering in 2018. 

If you have done PHD, or some other degree, you should mention and continue in same way. 
Also, do mention anything important that you have achieved during this period, like an important thesis, or a directors medal or anything.

Post this, you will start with your professional experience, in choronological order.
> I started my career with XYZ company, in Jan 2019. I was working on XYZ project, after that, I started with ABC project. My techstack during my tenure there was, X, Y, Z, ABC. 

After that, if you have switched to a different company before, you will start with why you switched.
> During my tenure in XYZ company, I felt a need for change as my techstack and job satisfaction was not enough. I started preparing, and got a offer from JKL company.

After all that, you reason them, why are you switching and why this company, or say something about your plans.
> Now I am looking for a change as I feel my knowledge is not being utilized and work is not challenging enough. I think I will get enough challenging work




Interviewer will ask you a question that can be specific, or underspecified
