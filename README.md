# Interview-Preparations
### How will interview start:
Interviewer always start with a brief introduction about themselves(in their current company only). After that, they will tell you about a bit of work/tech stack. There are generally two interviewers in an interview, one is the main interviewer, other is the senior guy, which acts as observer, and sometimes pitchin in case, he has something to ask, or want to correct something. Post that, your interview starts with a very basic question: Tell us something about yourself.
### How to answer "Tell me something about yourself?"
Well, you should preferably start with your degree, in chronological order. Resumes, are generally made in anti-chronological order, but in interview, your chronological order matters, because only that will showcase your growth and have impact on interviewers mind.


Interviewer will ask you a question that can be specific, or underspecified
